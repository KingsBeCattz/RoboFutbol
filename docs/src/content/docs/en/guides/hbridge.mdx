import { LinkCard, Aside, Tabs, TabItem, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Accordion, AccordionItem } from 'accessible-astro-components';

Our code, besides supporting several gamepads thanks to Bluepad32, also supports several H-bridges thanks to its pinout, here we show you which H-bridges we support and how to use them.

<Aside type="caution">
This project was built using the ESP32 microcontroller, if you don't have experience using it we recommend you to watch the intro tutorials.

    ### Relay Based H-Bridges
    Slower, but simple and useful in low frequency and home prototypes. An example of this could be as in the following image:
    <img src="/H_Bridge_Relay_Model.jpg" alt="Relay H-Bridge" loading="lazy" />
    This example shows two power supplies (the left one is 5v and the right one can be any voltage supported by the motor), two switches (IN1 and IN2), the motor and the bridge circuitry.

  <TabItem label="Transistor-based">
    ### Transistor Based H-Bridges
    Economical, but consume more base current. An example of this could be as in the following image:
    <img src="/H_Bridge_Transistor_Model.jpg" alt="Transistor H-Bridge" style="width: 100%;" loading="lazy" />
    This example shows the circuitry of the h-bridge, two switches and a motor, the same as the example with relays, with the difference that only one power source (5v) is used.

  <TabItem label="MOSFET-based">
    ### MOSFET Based H-Bridges
    Very efficient, used in almost everything today. There are N and P channel MOSFETs.

  <TabItem label="DriverIC-based">
    ### DriverIC Based H-Bridges
    They are integrated/chip based, integrate protection, logic and sometimes PWM control.

As you can see, absolutely all of these examples have one thing in common, the presence of an IN1 and IN2 to control the direction of a motor, in our code there is support for a maximum of two motors and 2 interfaces:
- Classic interface - Simple HIGH or LOW output
- PWM interface - PWM output from 0 to 255

Each mode has its respective pins, see them in:
