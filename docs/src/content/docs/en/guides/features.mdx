Our guide provides support for multiple gamepads — [click here to view the list of supported controllers](https://bluepad32.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported_gamepads/) — as well as compatibility with various types of H-bridges.

The system includes multiple control modes, **all configurable** at runtime:

- By default, speed is modulated using the **triggers** (RT/LT), and turning is controlled with the **left stick's X axis**.
- The **Select** button works as a toggle: pressing it switches speed control to the **left stick's Y axis**; pressing it again returns to the previous mode.
- The **Start** button also acts as a toggle: it switches turn control to the **right stick's X axis**, and toggles back with another press.
- You can also use the **d-pad** as a universal directional controller.
- If you're turning and press the **X button on Xbox** (or **Square on PlayStation**, **Y on Nintendo**), a **sharp/quick turn** is triggered immediately.

<Aside type="caution">
This project is built to run on the **ESP32 microcontroller**.  
If you’re not familiar with it, we recommend reviewing some introductory tutorials before continuing.
