Our guide provides support for multiple gamepads — [click here to view the list of supported controllers](https://bluepad32.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported_gamepads/) — as well as compatibility with various types of H-bridges.

The system supports both **ESP32 with Bluetooth controllers** and **Arduino-compatible boards with PS2 controllers**, with multiple control modes configurable at runtime:

- **ESP32 (Bluepad32)**: speed is modulated using the **triggers** (RT/LT), and turning is controlled with the **left stick's X axis** by default.
- **Arduino (PS2)**: left joystick → forward/backward (Y-axis), right joystick → left/right (X-axis).  
- Buttons control mode/power switching:
  - **SELECT** → switch power source
  - **START** → switch direction source
  - **X on Xbox / Square on PlayStation / Y on Nintendo** → manual drive
  - **Y on Xbox / Triangle on PlayStation / X on Nintendo** → exposition mode
  - **A on Xbox / Cross on PlayStation / B on Nintendo** → tank drive
- You can also use the **d-pad** as a universal directional controller.

<Aside type="caution">
This project is built to run on **ESP32 and Arduino-compatible microcontrollers**.  
If you’re not familiar with them, we recommend reviewing some introductory tutorials before continuing.
