This project was built using the ESP32 microcontroller, if you don't have experience using it we recommend you to watch the intro tutorials.

| Pin | Motor | Input | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPIO 25 | Motor 1 | IN1 | DIGITAL |
| GPIO 26 | Motor 1 | IN2 | DIGITAL |
| GPIO 27 | Motor 1 | IN1 | PWM |
| GPIO 14 | Motor 1 | IN2 | PWM |
| GPIO 33 | Motor 1 | ENABLE | DIGITAL |
| GPIO 32 | Motor 1 | PWM SPEED | PWM |
| GPIO 19 | Motor 2 | IN1 | DIGITAL |
| GPIO 18 | Motor 2 | IN2 | DIGITAL |
| GPIO 17 | Motor 2 | IN1 | PWM |
| GPIO 16 | Motor 2 | IN2 | PWM |
| GPIO 22 | Motor 2 | ENABLE | DIGITAL |
| GPIO 23 | Motor 2 | PWM SPEED | PWM |

<Aside type="tip">
Pins **GPIO 33** (Motor 1) and **GPIO 22** (Motor 2) act as **digital ENABLE pins**, used to activate the motor with a simple ON/OFF signal.  
Pins **GPIO 32** and **GPIO 23** are used for **dedicated PWM speed control**, separate from IN1 and IN2.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
If your H-bridge only requires PWM signals on IN1 and IN2, you can simply use the `ENABLE_PWM_OUT` flag.

If you're also using digital outputs (`ENABLE_DIGITAL_OUT`), you can achieve smoother behavior by enabling the `HOLD_DIGITAL` flag.

This flag **keeps the digital pins active** even when the speed is less than 100%, allowing the motor to maintain direction even at low speeds.  
> This replaces the old method of physically bridging GPIO 32 to GND to avoid sudden motor shutdowns at low speeds.
</Aside>

## Flag Configuration

You can control which pins are used via the following flags, which can be combined using the `|` operator at compile time:

```cpp
// Available flags
#define ENABLE_DIGITAL_OUT (1 << 0)  // Uses IN1/IN2 as digital ON/OFF outputs
#define ENABLE_PWM_OUT     (1 << 1)  // Uses PWM on IN1/IN2
#define ENABLE_EN_OUT      (1 << 2)  // Uses dedicated ENABLE pins
#define ENABLE_SPEED_OUT   (1 << 3)  // Uses dedicated PWM pins for speed control
#define HOLD_DIGITAL       (1 << 4)  // Keeps IN1/IN2 active even if speed < 100%

// Basic example: only PWM on IN1/IN2
#define flags (ENABLE_PWM_OUT)

// Full setup: PWM + ENABLE + speed control + digital retention
#define flags (ENABLE_PWM_OUT | ENABLE_EN_OUT | ENABLE_SPEED_OUT | ENABLE_DIGITAL_OUT | HOLD_DIGITAL)
```

### What does `HOLD_DIGITAL` do?

When `HOLD_DIGITAL` is active, the digital outputs (IN1 or IN2) **stay ON as long as a direction is present**, even if the speed is low.

This prevents the motor from “cutting off” when direction is present but the speed is not at 100%, such as in the 10%-90% range, reducing jerks and enabling smoother motion.

> ⚠️ If you don’t use `HOLD_DIGITAL`, the digital pins will automatically turn OFF unless the direction reaches 100%, which can cause unwanted stops or stutters.

## Logic Table: Which Pins Activate per `flag`

| Active Flag         | Pins Used                                     | Description |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `ENABLE_DIGITAL_OUT` | `GPIO 25`, `GPIO 26`, `GPIO 19`, `GPIO 18`   | Uses IN1 and IN2 as basic ON/OFF digital outputs |
| `ENABLE_PWM_OUT`     | `GPIO 27`, `GPIO 14`, `GPIO 17`, `GPIO 16`   | Uses IN1 and IN2 with PWM modulation |
| `ENABLE_EN_OUT`      | `GPIO 33`, `GPIO 22`                         | Dedicated digital ENABLE pins for each motor |
| `ENABLE_SPEED_OUT`   | `GPIO 32`, `GPIO 23`                         | Dedicated PWM pins for speed control |
| `HOLD_DIGITAL`       | *Depends on direction* + `ENABLE_DIGITAL_OUT` | Keeps digital pins active even if speed < 100% |

<Aside type="note">
⚠️ The `HOLD_DIGITAL` flag **does not activate pins by itself** — it modifies the behavior of `ENABLE_DIGITAL_OUT`.  
When active, it prevents IN1/IN2 from turning off at low speeds while a direction is still present.
